# Incident disclosure - 29-11-2023

## Key Points:

- Vulnerability in LiquidityGaugeV4XChain: A flaw was detected in the withdraw function, allowing external parties to drain the balances of any user.
- An individual exploited this vulnerability, leading to the substantial depletion of the PancakeSwap Pool's resources.
- In response, Stake DAO collaborated with the PancakeSwap team to kill the stableswap pool, thereby preventing further transactions including exchanges, liquidity additions, or removals.
- The vulnerability affected sdCAKE, a synthetic token representing the locked CAKE in the Locker. It is important to note that actual funds were not at direct risk due to the synthetic nature of sdCAKE, besides funds in the pool.
- Stake DAO took prompt action by deploying a new version of sdCAKE and executing an airdrop to all holders of the previously minted sdCAKE.
- For stakeholders who either added liquidity or purchased sdCAKE, Stake DAO ensured full reimbursement in CAKE tokens. This reimbursement was inclusive of all affected users, regardless of their liquidity withdrawal status.
