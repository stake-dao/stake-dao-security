# Incident disclosure - 29-11-2023

## Key Points:

- Vulnerability in `LiquidityGaugeV4XChain` contract: A flaw was detected in the withdraw function, allowing external parties to drain the balances of any user.
- An individual exploited this vulnerability, leading to the substantial depletion of the PancakeSwap Pool's resources.
- In response, Stake DAO collaborated with the PancakeSwap team to kill the stableswap pool, thereby preventing further transactions including exchanges, liquidity additions, or removals.
- The vulnerability affected sdCAKE, a synthetic token representing the locked CAKE in the Locker. It is important to note that actual funds were not at direct risk due to the synthetic nature of sdCAKE, besides funds in the pool.
- Stake DAO took prompt action by deploying a new version of sdCAKE and executing an airdrop to all holders of the previously minted sdCAKE.
- For stakeholders who either added liquidity or purchased sdCAKE, Stake DAO ensured full reimbursement in CAKE tokens. This reimbursement was inclusive of all affected users, regardless of their liquidity withdrawal status.

## Background

- Stake DAO, in a collaboration with PancakeSwap, has deployed its Liquid Locker system on the BNB Chain, integrated atop the existing veCAKE Locker.
- This Liquid Locker system is architecturally composed of a central `Locker` contract, which securely holds the locked assets, complemented by a receipt token (`sdToken`) that represents the user's proportional share in the lock, and a `LiquidityGauge` contract, which is pivotal in the distribution of staking rewards from the locker.

- At Stake DAO, we use multiple implementation of the `LiquidityGauge` depending of our needs:

 1. `LiquidityGauge` for lockers applying the SDT Boost on all rewards.
 2. `LiquidityGauge` for lockers without the SDT Boost
 3. `LiquidityGauge` for yield strategies applying the SDT Boost on SDT rewards only.
 4. `LiquidityGauge` for yield strategies without the SDT Boost.

Implementations without SDT Boost are orchestrated through an intermediary contract mechanism. Stakeholders deposit their funds into this middle-man contract, which then interacts with the LiquidityGauge. The design asserts that deposits and withdrawals are exclusively conducted through this intermediary, maintaining a controlled and secure transaction flow.

## Details of Incident

* During the deployment process, an erroneous selection of the LiquidityGauge implementation occurred. Given the absence of the SDT Boost feature in sidechain operations, the deployed version was appropriately one without this boost. However, instead of deploying the version tailored for lockers, the implementation designed for yield strategies was mistakenly utilized, lacking the critical safeguard that ensures only a designated middleman contract can initiate calls to it.

* This oversight in the deployment resulted in a significant security vulnerability: the withdraw function within the LiquidityGauge contract was exposed, allowing any external party to initiate withdrawal transactions on behalf of other users.

* An individual identified this vulnerability and exploited it, managing to withdraw a majority of the stakes for several users, capitalizing on the exposed security flaw in the system.

* Subsequently, the individual proceeded to liquidate the withdrawn assets by dumping them into the PancakeSwap Pool, further exploiting the security breach.

* In response to this critical situation, we promptly contacted the PancakeSwap team and requested to kill the pool. This decisive action was taken to prevent other users from becoming exit liquidity for the individual who exploited the vulnerability.

* By the time the pool was successfully killed, the total loss incurred amounted to 1,767.117663562056265433 CAKE, which is approximately valued at $4,011.35709629.

## Details of Fix

* To address and rectify the issue, we implemented the correct version of the LiquidityGauge staking contract. This version, audited by ChainSecurity, does not include the boost feature. Additionally, we upgraded to the latest version as recommended by a private security auditor, ensuring enhanced security and compliance with the latest standards.

* We conducted a snapshot of the sdCAKE. This included recording all instances of sdCAKE minted by users, as well as identifying users who had either added liquidity to, or purchased sdCAKE directly from, the pool. 

* We deployed a new version of the sdCAKE token along with an updated Depositor contract. To rectify the situation for affected users, we executed an airdrop, distributing this new sdCAKE staked in the gauge to the users identified in the earlier snapshot.

* To further mitigate the impact on affected users, the Treasury proactively acquired 1,767.117663562056265433 CAKE tokens. These were airdropped to compensate for the losses incurred due to the vulnerability. Notably, some users ended up with a net gain, as the compensation did not factor in any liquidity withdrawals or sales of sdCAKE that they might have executed prior to the incident.
